    !!! failure "An AI of a remarkable Artist that already passed away ... : ( ..."
        - During the class time, I had an idea, but this idea was in my heart for a long-long-long-time. Which is to deeply study or deeply collective informations about ==Modernisme== (Catalan pronunciation: [muðərˈnizmə], Catalan for "modernism"), also known as ==Catalan modernism== and ==Catalan art nouveau== 

        >What is Catalan modernism?

        The History of Modernism in Catalan modernisme refers to not just an artistic style, but a ==cultural movement== that spanned across ==architecture, art, music, literature, and society as a whole.==

            ##“Modernisme has many faces and echoes a certain ambiguity,” 
            Mariàngels Fondevila, curator at Museu Nacional d'Art de Catalunya

        !!!quote "Conversation"
            By having a conversation with Albert, which he is a Catalan man. 
        
            I asked Albert: "Do you like Guadi?"

            ALbert answered: "I used to like it, but nowdays, La Sagrada Familia being changed =A Lot="


        >I started to questioning myself, why people starts to hate it? Is that because Guadi? or people who building/designing/constructing it  NOWdays? People keep saying that they are pasing Guadi's art pieces to complish it. But is that a ==real== opinion done by Guadi? I mean, he is in the heaven. Or maybe he had a ==code== that later people can/needs to be ==followed==? Also, for designing a architecture is not only designing ==1/one/uno== building, it should including the surroundings, to conbine together and make a best decision. 


        !!!question
            >* what if we collected all the data of Guadi's art work then move it to AI to help us do the best calculating and fair desicions.
