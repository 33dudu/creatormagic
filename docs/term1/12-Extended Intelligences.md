        - During the class time, I had an idea, but this idea was in my heart for a long-long-long-time. Which is to deeply study or deeply collective informations about ==Modernisme== (Catalan pronunciation: [muðərˈnizmə], Catalan for "modernism"), also known as ==Catalan modernism== and ==Catalan art nouveau== 

        >What is Catalan modernism?

        The History of Modernism in Catalan modernisme refers to not just an artistic style, but a ==cultural movement== that spanned across ==architecture, art, music, literature, and society as a whole.== 

        !!!quote 
            <center>

            ##“Modernisme has many faces and echoes a certain ambiguity,”

        !!!quote "Conversation"
            By having a conversation with Albert, which he is a Catalan man. 
        
            I asked Albert: "Do you like Guadi?"

            ALbert answered: "I used to like it, but nowdays, La Sagrada Familia being changed =A Lot="


        >I started to questioning myself, why people starts to hate it? Is that because Guadi? or people who building/designing/constructing it  NOWdays? People keep saying that they are pasing Guadi's art pieces to complish it. But is that a ==real== opinion done by Guadi? I mean, he is in the heaven. Or maybe he had a ==code== that later people can/needs to be ==followed==? Also, for designing a architecture is not only designing ==1/one/uno== building, it should including the surroundings, to conbine together and make a best decision.

        - M3GAN is a marvel of artificial intelligence, a lifelike doll that's programmed to be a child's greatest companion and a parent's greatest ally. Designed by Gemma, a brilliant roboticist, M3GAN can listen, watch and learn as it plays the role of friend and teacher, playmate and protector. When Gemma becomes the unexpected caretaker of her 8-year-old niece, she decides to give the girl an M3GAN prototype, a decision that leads to unimaginable consequences.
        
        - M3GAN (pronounced "Megan") is a 2022 American science fiction horror film directed by Gerard Johnstone. It was written by Akela Cooper from a story by Cooper and James Wan (who also produced with Jason Blum). Allison Williams and Violet McGraw star, Amie Donald physically portrays M3GAN, and Jenna Davis voices the character.

    | Description | 	The WikiArt dataset contains paintings from 195 different artists. The dataset has 42129 images for training and 10628 images for testing. Because WikiArt is available to the public, it has a well-developed structure, WikiArt is often used in the field of machine learning. Namely, it is used to train AI on WikiArt data to discover its ability to recognize, classify, and generate art.
    | Interest | During my undergraduate studies, I pursued a double major in Interior Architecture and Art History. However, my particular passion lies in Art History. I am intrigued by the origins of each art movement, the underlying logic and philosophical aspects, and the reasons leading to their eventual ==manifestations==.
    |          | Throughout my exploration of Art History, I actively traced the ==roots== of each art movement, delving deep into their ==ideologies and philosophical foundations==. I gained a profound understanding of how societal, cultural, and historical factors influence art movements. I sought to comprehend the origins and development of these movements from an artistic perspective, considering the unique environments and social contexts of each period.
    |          | Each art movement is like a canvas saturated with the thoughts and reflections of artists of that time. I am excited by the unique creativity and ideas that emerge within these movements. Through artworks spanning different eras, I aim to understand how artists serve as cultural commentators of their times by expressing their viewpoints and emotions.
    |          | While pursuing a profound understanding of art movements, my interest extends to the evolution of their ultimate forms. I believe that interpreting artworks from ==logical and philosophical== perspectives ==not only aids in appreciating their aesthetics== but also reveals ==deeper layers of thoughts and emotions embedded in these creations==.
    |          | In summary, my academic background fuels my deep curiosity about the origins and development of art movements. I look forward to further exploring and understanding the cultural and philosophical implications of different art movements and how they have influenced the evolution and presentation of art.

    !!! quote 
        ##“The famous pipe. How people reproached me for it! And yet, could you stuff my pipe? No, it’s just a representation, is it not? So if I had written on my picture “This is a pipe”, I’d have been lying!”  
        — wrote René Magritte about his brilliant concept and artwork “The Treachery of Images”.

        > This quote is from René Magritte, a famous surrealist artist, and it refers to his painting "The Treachery of Images" ("La trahison des images" in French). The painting features a pipe, accompanied by the text "Ceci n'est pas une pipe" (This is not a pipe) below it.

        >Magritte's statement reflects the philosophical idea that an image or representation is not the same as the real object it represents. The pipe in the painting is just an image of a pipe, not a functional pipe that one could smoke. The text challenges the viewer to consider the distinction between representation and reality.

        >Magritte's work often explored the relationship between words and images, and "The Treachery of Images" is a prime example of his fascination with the nature of perception and language in art. The painting invites viewers to question their assumptions about representation and prompts philosophical reflections on the nature of reality in art.

        ## Introduction:

        In an increasingly environmentally-conscious world, efficient waste management has become a global priority. This document introduces an innovative solution: an artificial intelligence (AI) specialized in trash tracking. This AI not only identifies objects as garbage but also provides valuable information to enhance waste management. Throughout this document, we will explore the fundamentals of this technology, its advanced capabilities, and the positive impact it can have on environmental sustainability and waste management efficiency.

        ## Creation: 

        Data set: For selecting the information library, initially, our focus was on searching for specific datasets to recognize beverage cans and cigarettes. Even during the process, we proposed creating a small dataset with images to label the brands. Due to time constraints, we opted for a library that specializes in trash recognition called TACO.

        Neural networking: We came across YOLO, a neural network for image detection and recognition that is also compatible with the chosen dataset.



        ## Coding: 

        Since the dataset from TACO uses COCO format, we first need to convert it to the files needed by YOLO. The requirements to train YOLO with our custom dataset are as follows:
        
        > A: Splitting the dataset to a folder containing an “images” folder and a “labels” folder for training, another containing  an “images” folder and a “labels” folder for validation and an optional folder containing an “images” folder and a “labels” folder for testing

        > B: A .yaml file that contains the list of classifications and paths to the mentioned folders. See appendix.

        **Training: the following command trains the model**
        > !yolo task=detect mode=train model=yolov8n.pt data=/content/trash_data/trash_data.yaml epochs=25 imgsz=640

        ## Parameters:
        1. data = path to the .yaml file
        2. epochs = number of iterations. More epochs means longer training.
        3. imgsz = image size

        > This outputs 2 new models: best.pt and last.pt

        **Detecting: we can now use the following  command to detect objects in an image we give it**

        > !yolo task=detect mode=predict model="/content/train/weights/best.pt" source="/content/20231205_004350.jpg

        Sample output:
        
        ![](../images/bingo/taco01.png){: style="height:500px;width:500px"}



        ## Conclusions:

        1- From the dataset that recognizes objects as trash, we question what criteria define the initiation of an object to be categorized as garbage.

        2 - To improve the precision of the model, the neural network should be trained with more epochs (time).
        
        3 - On surveillance and accountability: We can combine it with a text or label detection in order to trace the origin of the product and the companies responsible for the waste.
