        > Purple Queen Received Its Looks From Hindu Kush and Purple Afghani

        Some say that purple is the colour of good judgement; Purple Queen is the cool purple strain for the wise weed grower indeed. Sticky green is good, but pure, frosty purple flowers are fantastic. And not just to look at. Purple Queen lays the smackdown. Its powerful physical effects will take you deep. Deep into the couch and probably the fridge, too. Smooth, full-bodied Kush flavour with a slight lemon twist will delight your palate as you gently float off to dreamland. These gorgeous looks were only possible thanks to parent strains Hindu Kush and Purple Afghani.

        > Purple Queen is Compact and Highly Productive
        
        Purple Queen reigns supreme in the cannabis garden. Indoors, or outdoors in temperate to warm climates, these cannabis seeds can and probably will stun you with her gooey purple nugs. In just 8 weeks of 12/12, or by mid-September outdoors, it will be ready for harvest. Purple Queen is a compact, branchy Kush hybrid that will mature to purple dream weed without a fuss. Itâ€™ll fill out lateral grow space and will rarely exceed 1m in height. Over thousands of years, the ancient Kush genetics from which it is derived have developed incredible resistance as well as spectacular purple hues. Purple Queen can tolerate high doses of fertilisers and will thrive in any growing system from organics to hydroponics.
