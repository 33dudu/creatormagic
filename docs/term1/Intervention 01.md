    We should not design a solution, the solution will shows up by itself once we work with the society and the community.

    We should work outside of the "BUBBLES" (means ourselves). 

    We should not only seating infront of our computer or desk. 

    We should go outside, get the information, get the feedback, get the problem, test the problems.
