    > Different regions nurture different people." This expression suggests that the characteristics of a particular environment, including its water and soil conditions, influence the development and traits of the people living in that region. It emphasizes the close relationship between the natural environment and the cultural or physical attributes of the inhabitants

    > Conflict

    In this neighborhood, lots of folks are locals, many born and raised right here. But things changed when money got involved – now it's a place with a bunch of workers. You'll see new buildings and construction spots all over. Still, there are some old houses mixed in, hanging on in the middle of all the changes. It's like a mix of the old and the new, showing how things are shifting in this community.

        > On a sunny morning, as we explored the soil, our direction was set to =="follow the sun"== in our quest for understanding SOIL. Amidst this journey, my peripheral vision caught sight of a captivating array of handcrafted artwork. Adjacent to this creative haven stood a gentleman. I greeted him with a cheerful "HOLA," and his warm smile became an assurance of the friendliness within. I turned to Jose(Annna) and asked her to convey our interest in visiting his studio and engaging in a conversation. He graciously accepted.

        > The communication then passed to Jose(Annna). Inside the studio, despite my best efforts to comprehend Catalan (after 205 days on Duolingo), I found myself struggling. So, I assumed the role of a photographer, attempting to capture the essence of the room filled with incredible art—hand-drawn constructions, paper, magazines—forming a mesmerizing tapestry. It was a testament to the reality that nowadays, technology often intertwines with the artistic process.

        > One of the highlights was the incredible experience of conversing with a local from Catalonia, despite the two-generational gap. A heartfelt thanks to Jose(Annna), who skillfully used her local gifts to bridge the communication gap and make this encounter so special. ❤️

        > As we explored the soil, we found ourselves enveloped by art, information, and manifestos along the way. We deeply appreciated how the people of Barcelona utilized the streets as a canvas for artistic expression and the sharing of personal ideas and group manifestos. Graffiti served as a vast city-wide canvas, and by observing the walls, we absorbed a wealth of information.

        > Yet, a conflict emerged during our exploration: ==how could we effectively capture and preserve these remarkable expressions of art and information for posterity?== The city's walls exhibited a dynamic quality, transforming with new graffiti or turning into blank slates within a mere few days.

        >The places where angels reside are always clean and refreshing, as if capable of purifying the soul and bringing a smile to your face. Even if there might be some slight untidiness, it remains pleasing to the eye. However, for angels, they always trust humans unconditionally, so please take good care of your belongings.
