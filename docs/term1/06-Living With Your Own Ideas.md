    ##I unveiled my latest art sculpture, a masterpiece I affectionately named ==HARIBO DE HARWEEN==. This unique creation is a testament to my exploration of artistic possibilities within the realm of discarded materials.

    ##The genesis of this project led me to ponder a profound question: =="How can wastes be treated artistically?"== Armed with curiosity and a commitment to sustainability, I delved into my household's most commonly ==wasted bio materials==. The resounding answers ==emerged—makeup remover towels paired with toilet paper rolls, and coffee powder intertwined with eggshells==.

    ##Weekend experimentation ensued to test the viability of these materials for sculptural purposes. 
    
    I employed two distinct drying methods—firstly,
    1. utilizing the weight of heavy objects and an indoor environment, 
    2. basking in the warmth of the Mediterranean sun and the caress of the wind in an outdoor setting.

    As October waned into the 31st, the results were promising, leaving me with a modest bag of leftovers. During a serendipitous moment in class, I stumbled upon a discarded hard disk drive in IAAC room 301. It became the unexpected mold for my artistic endeavor. Into its metallic embrace, I carefully placed the remnants, opting for the ==outdoor drying method== once again.

    Myself, serving as both creator and instrument, infused a distinctive perspective and vision into the sculpture. It highlighted the symbiotic relationship between the artist and the material, transcending the mere act of creation.

    Looking ahead, a second iteration of the waste materials beckons. This time, a new step emerges—using ==mortar to delicately smash the eggshells==. The palette expands, introducing two colors: 1. with the richness of coffee powder. 2. in its pure, unadorned form.

    As the project unfolds, it becomes more than just a sculpture; it transforms into a narrative of renewal, where discarded materials find beauty, purpose, and a second chance. May this artistic journey continue to captivate and inspire, a celebration of sustainability and creativity intertwined.
