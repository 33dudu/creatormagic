!!! question "GOAL"
    This is an excellent opportunity for me. With a background in art history and interior architecture design, it seems like the perfect fit for a standard curator role. Perhaps my goal could be to design an interior exhibition space that serves as a culmination of my current stage also helping my classmate to organize the space. I intend to draw inspiration from Catalan modern architecture and street art.
