                > Link to the past: https://33dudu.github.io/magicreator/term1/06-Living%20With%20Your%20Own%20Ideas/

                The main idea was to use the past/present/future as a strategy for this design dialogue. Let's start with the past—a seminar during school focused on 'Living with Your Own Ideas.' I questioned myself about the biggest waste in my personal lifetime, which turned out to be coffee powder, eggshells, and paper. Combining them, I created a new type of recycled paper to draw on. However, my ambition led me to use this recycled paper to make waterproof art, envisioning dolphins in the ocean appreciating my work(THE FURTURE DREAM).

                During class time in the MDEF classroom, I discovered a new waste from machine—discarded disks. I used these disks as molds or as a "brain" for my projects. Imagining the future, I envisioned placing these waste art pieces in my home. Proudly introducing them to my friends, I would say, 'Look, guys, these art pieces are made from trash.'"

                In the upcoming phase, I challenged myself to step out of my comfort zone. I want to express my gratitude to Tomas for awakening me. Initially, I was merely attempting to create an internal space for Dialogue Day. However, during my conversation with Tomas, he pointed out a crucial issue. Subsequently, I introspected and identified my weak point, which turned out to be technology.

                In an effort to address this, I explored the MDEF classroom and sought out abandoned machines that resonated with me. Ultimately, I settled on an old 80s TV. My goal was to connect it to my iPhone 14 Plus. After several attempts and searches, I succeeded. Upon inspecting the connectors, it felt surreal to witness the integration of this ancient machinery with the latest technology. **It's a conversation between history and the present, symbolizing a bridge between the past and the future.**

        This is an excellent opportunity for me. With a background in art history and interior architecture design, it seems like the perfect fit for a standard curator role. Perhaps my goal could be to design an interior exhibition space that serves as a culmination of my current stage also helping my classmate to organize the space. I intend to draw inspiration from Catalan modern architecture and street art.
