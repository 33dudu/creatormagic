        - #**Transhumanisms**

        Transhumanism is the position that human beings should be permitted to use technology to modify and enhance human cognition and bodily function, expanding abilities and capacities beyond current biological constraints. Transhumanism is characterized by a set of core values emphasizing positive experience and recognizing the limitations of human cognition and embodiment in achieving maximally positive experience. A set of nonnecessary but common secondary values and positions associated with transhumanism include individualism, libertarianism, pragmatism, and physicalism. Influenced by Enlightenment ideals, transhumanism has been criticized from a variety of perspectives, including those religious and secular and those socially conservative and socially liberal

        >### =="Alita: Battle Angel"==  is a 2019 science fiction action film directed by Robert Rodriguez and produced by James Cameron. The film is based on Yukito Kishiro's manga series "Gunnm," also known as "Battle Angel Alita." The screenplay was written by James Cameron and Laeta Kalogridis. The movie is set in a post-apocalyptic future and follows the story of Alita, a cyborg who is found in a scrapyard by Dr. Dyson Ido, played by Christoph Waltz. Alita has lost her memory but retains her incredible combat abilities. As she navigates the dangerous world of Iron City, she discovers her past and confronts powerful forces.

        >###The film features a mix of live-action and computer-generated imagery (CGI) to bring the futuristic world and its characters to life. Rosa Salazar portrays the titular character, Alita, using motion capture technology to create a realistic and expressive CGI character.

        >### "Alita: Battle Angel" received praise for its visual effects, action sequences, and the portrayal of the main character. However, opinions on the film were mixed, and it didn't achieve massive box office success. Despite this, the movie has gained a dedicated fan base and sparked discussions about the possibility of a sequel. As of my last knowledge update in January 2022, there hadn't been official announcements regarding a sequel, but plans for a follow-up were discussed by the filmmakers and fans.
