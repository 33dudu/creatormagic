<h1> 
REFLECTION: </h1>

<p> I made a new art sculpture called HARIBO DE HARWEEN. 


The sculpture is made with WASTES. 
I was questioning myself /HOW TO TREAT WASTES ARTISTICALLY?/
10/28/2023
I started ask myself two questions 
 /Which bio materials are the most commonly wasted at my home?/
 /Which organic food materials are the most commonly wasted at my home?/
The answers are /Makeup remover towel & Toilet paper roll/ /Coffee powder & Egg shell/  
Then I  tested the  materials during the weekend to see if the new material can be hard enough to make a sculpture? There are two ways to dry my material which is 
/ No.1 by using heavy things to press it and put it in indoor space for two days./
/ No.2 by using Mediterranean sunshine and wind(outdoor) for two days./
10/31/2023
After testing the new material there is a little bag of leftovers.
During class time I found a WASTED HARD DISK DRIVE in IAAC room 301.
I used the wasted hard disk drive as a MOLDER. 
Then I start put the leftover material into the hard disk
I used No.2 (sunshine & wind) method to dry the sculpture.
Use myself as an instrument, the most important is the way to see the world; the perspective; the vision.
For the next step I would like to make a second version of the waste materials. By adding one more step: use the mortar to smash the egg shell.
Also, made two colors, by adding the coffee powder and without coffee powder.
