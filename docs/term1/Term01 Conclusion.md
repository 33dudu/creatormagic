        It was nice to have the winter break spended in Jamaica. Its helped me  to enlarge the perspective of seeing the world and rethinking about the environment and the waste. Serveal weak signal in jamaica  1. The understanding of wasted/trash is different compared to the city.  • For example, people in the city will through the garbage to the trash can，and the trash company will help us dealing with those wasted. but people in jamaica who live in the natue will burn the trash/ garbage, so, considered the pollution or health situation from burning the pLastic just right next to you while you are playing dominos or swimming in the river.  • Also, the age of the trash. People live in the city will throw a new plastic or trash immediately after they finish it. But people i met in jamaica will reuse the wasted.  ( can we design a machine that can dissolve breakdown the wasted in the local neighborhood and printed as a new useable thing?) 2. A good point from jamaica teenage Chris.
