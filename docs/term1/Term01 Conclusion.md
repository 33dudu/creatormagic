!!! question "Introduction"

    _1. WHAT IS YOUR PURPOSE?_

    !!! info ""
        To be honest, I have never known what my purpose is; I've simply gone with the flow and pursued my passions. However, one thing I am certain about is my love for tropical islands, nature, and my dislike for city lifestyle. I aspire to contribute to initiatives that benefit people in natural settings, whether it involves addressing the issue of waste or exploring technological solutions. 
                
        **In essence, my primary goal is to protect and preserve tropical islands, whether through addressing waste issues, exploring technological solutions, or contributing in diverse ways to ensure their long-term well-being.**

        ### Jamaica 
        
        [12/24/23-01/03/24]

        !!!info "<font color="red">Jamaica Balls</font>"
            <font color="green">Every single one in this earth love the **pretty things**, then what about the **ugly things**? Let me give a try to solve this bug. 

            **BUG**: How to solve the trash and either make it to a functional or aesthetic. To let the ==Pretty== & ==Ugly== to stay at a balance. </font>
        !!!warning ""
            It was nice to have the winter break spended in Jamaica. Its helped me  to enlarge the perspective of seeing the world and rethinking about the environment and the waste. Serveal weak signal in jamaica  1. The understanding of wasted/trash is different compared to the city.  • For example, people in the city will through the garbage to the trash can，and the trash company will help us dealing with those wasted. but people in jamaica who live in the natue will burn the trash/ garbage, so, considered the pollution or health situation from burning the pLastic just right next to you while you are playing dominos or swimming in the river.  • Also, the age of the trash. People live in the city will throw a new plastic or trash immediately after they finish it. But people i met in jamaica will reuse the wasted.  ( can we design a machine that can dissolve breakdown the wasted in the local neighborhood and printed as a new useable thing?) 2. A good point from jamaica teenage Chris. The sounds pollution  Sounds system

    _2. Reflect on your own RtD toolbox based on your vison and identity. Select the **main roles of prototyping** and other design activities that you want to use based on the contect you are in._

    _3. In order to better understand and position yourself in your current space, locality and context, you can make a visual inventory of **tools, spaces and materials** you can work with and add a few lines reflecting on it._
