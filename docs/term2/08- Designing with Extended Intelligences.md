        **Superintelligence**
        > Refers to intellects that greatly otperform the best current human minds across many very general cognitive domains.

        - Speed: A system that can do something human can do but faster

        - Collectives: A ystem composed of a large number of small intellects such that the system overall performance outstrips that of any current cognitive system

        - Quality: A system that is at least as fast a human mind vastly qualitatively smarter 

        - Creativity?????

        **Generative AI**

        > Generative Ai refers to a class of artifical intelligence algorithms and models that are designed to generate new content that is similar to, but not identical to, the data they were trained on. These models learn the underlying patters and structures of the data they are exposed to and then use that understanding to create new content.

        **What is a bias in a AI model?**
        > Language models are prone to machine learning bias, since the model was trained on internet data, it has potential to lear and exhibit many of the biases that humans exhibit online.
        
        - Training Data bias

        - Algoeithmic bias

        - Cogenitive bias

!!! danger "Reflection"
    !!! note ""
        "It was an interesting seminar to research and play around with the tools of dottod and modmatrix. However, for me, with a background in interior architecture and the history of art, using AI to create art was initially a challenging experience since I was afraid we would lose humanity in our society. But the good thing to note is that these two programs make me not feel as bad about using AI to generate art. I realized that the prompt can change a lot of the art, which now makes me wonder if we live in the world or the 'wor(l)d'."
