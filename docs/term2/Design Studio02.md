        :question: What is ALTERNATIVE?
        
        - In design, the term **"alternative"** refers to unconventional or non-traditional approaches, solutions, or concepts that deviate from the mainstream or common practices. Designers often explore alternatives to push creative boundaries, solve problems in innovative ways, and challenge established norms. 


        :question: **Present continuities**

        - The current ways people deal with waste on Earth are divided between urban and natural environments. Let's focus on urban areas. Before the holiday, I asked for help from two Chinese restaurants to collect the wasted of the egg trays. These trays are considered garbage by the restaurant staff. After using the eggs, they discard the trays, creating a cycle of this material.

        :question: **Alternative Present**

        - Every time I visit these restaurants, due to my background, I notice many shortcomings in how they organize their space and tabletops. However, if we were to directly address this with them, they might opt to purchase new "trash containers." If possible, we could utilize the waste they collect and, through our design thinking, create items that are not only unique but also useful for them. This could be a solution.

        :question: **Collective design interventions that support this alternative present**
