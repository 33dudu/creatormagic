    _**Initial idea/ Concept:**_
    
    ![](../images/term2/micro%20i/interest.png){: style="height:400px;width:480px"}

    ## Our concept combines a **gyroscope** with a **sound system** add-on, using eco-friendly **bio-materials**. While this introduces **electrical components**, it aims to minimize wastefulness, appealing to eco-conscious consumers.

    **_Design problems and how the team solved them:_**
    
    1. Soldering

    > Our design is aim to be a ear cliff, so the size of the chips are really strick, while we were soldering, the chips were too small and we also need to clean the soldring that we did before and add on the new wireline.  

    2. Conncect gryscope and analog music
