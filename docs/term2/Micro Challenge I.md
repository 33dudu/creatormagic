    ### **The Awkward Phase of Learning a New Language**

    JOKE 01 
    > Imagine an Italian who uses the same word "ciao" for both "hello" and "goodbye." When encountering Spanish, where "adios" is used for farewell, they suddenly vanish and start saying "holahola" instead😹.

    JOKE 02
    > There was a woman who woke up very early to catch the bus to pick up a package. Finally, the bus arrived, but it stopped right in front of the woman. The driver explained, "Espéreme cinco minutos(Wait for me for five minutes)." However, due to waking up too early, her brain hadn't fully woken up yet, and instead of saying "vale" (okay), she accidentally said "hola" (hello)😸. This turned into a hilarious situation on the bus. When the woman got off, the driver even smiled and waved goodbye through the rearview mirror, signaling "adios."

        > I decide that my personal interest in this challenge are electronic waste and soundsystem. My **"hola"mate**[Nicolò Baldi](https://niente010.github.io/MDEF_website/#welcome):point_left: has interested in Bio plastic and conductive bio materials. By combining our interests, we decided to choose our application as our body. By applying sounds on our body we decided to use the bone conduction to transmit the sound. To add a little bit spice we also combine the gyroscope as our part of the game 😶‍🌫️

        > This is our attempt to develop a DIY Bio-Electrical earring: the initial concept was to modify an audio file through head movements. The signal that goes to the speaker was supposed to pass through a conductive bioplastic, in order to create an umpredictable noise to the track. Unfortunately, due to few time available, we had to simplify the project, and here we will illustrate our attempt.

        > This prototype allows you to change the pitch of an analog tone through the values of a gyroscope, and reproduce the sound in real-time through a spekaer.

    !!! info ""
        This was a one-week micro challenge, and it was also our first challenge. During this whole week, time went by so fast. With two people in a group, we had a lot to learn, and our time management and workflow separation needed improvement. This time, we mainly focused on the electronic components. We did not leave enough time for the facade design, and the electronic component connections were a huge challenge for us. Since we were trying to create a wearable item for the ear, we needed to ensure everything was small, so we spent a lot of time on soldering. In the end, we realized that the soldering station is extremely important, and having a third hand is essential for soldering. I loved this micro challenge even though it was super intense, but I learned a lot from it.
