        My privilege is my Bi-polar mental healthy. It's turning my emotional struggles into a privilege for my art. Initially, I grappled with the challenges of unstable mental health, but delving into the worlds of art history and psychology changed my perspective.

        Studying these subjects allowed me to form a deep connection with myself. Rather than viewing my emotional challenges negatively, I embraced them as allies in my creative process. The profound feelings that once troubled me have now become the driving force behind my artistic expression.

        Through art, I've found a beautiful way to befriend myself. Every stroke on the canvas becomes a release, and the emotional richness infuses my work with authenticity. It's not just about stabilizing my mental well-being; it's about turning vulnerability into strength.

        This fusion of emotional exploration and artistic expression has become a privilege — a source of inspiration that allows me to create art that is not only visually striking but also deeply meaningful. In embracing the tumultuous waves of my emotions, I've discovered the power of turning personal challenges into a canvas of beauty and resilience.

        Film: Metropolis(1927)
        !!! abstract "ChatGPT"
            "Metropolis" is a German expressionist science-fiction film directed by Fritz Lang. It was released in 1927 and is considered one of the pioneering works of the science fiction genre in cinema. Here are some key points about the film:

            **Director:** Fritz Lang

            **Release Date:** January 10, 1927

            **Genre:** Science Fiction, Dystopian

            **Plot Summary:**
            "Metropolis" is set in a futuristic dystopian city divided into two classes: the wealthy elite who live in luxurious skyscrapers above ground, and the oppressed working class who toil in harsh conditions below ground. The city is governed by Joh Fredersen, who oversees the construction of a massive skyscraper called the "New Tower of Babel." The protagonist, Freder, is the son of Joh Fredersen. When he discovers the plight of the workers, he becomes determined to bridge the gap between the classes.

            The film explores themes of class struggle, industrialization, and the consequences of unchecked technological progress. It also features a humanoid robot called Maria, created by the inventor Rotwang, who becomes a central figure in the narrative.

            **Influence and Legacy:**
            "Metropolis" is celebrated for its groundbreaking special effects, innovative set design, and iconic imagery. The film's visual style, characterized by elaborate and monumental sets, has left a lasting impact on the science fiction genre and cinema as a whole.

            Despite its initial critical and commercial challenges, "Metropolis" has since gained recognition as a classic and influential film. Various restored versions have been released over the years, and it continues to be studied and appreciated for its cinematic achievements and its thematic exploration of societal issues.

            The film's influence can be seen in later science fiction works, including Ridley Scott's "Blade Runner" and many other dystopian films that explore the consequences of a divided society. "Metropolis" remains a significant part of film history, showcasing the artistic and storytelling possibilities of the medium.

        ## :question: How to separate economic growth from its negative impacts on the environment?

        **:world_map:The goal is to keep the economy growing while reducing its harmful effects on the planet. Focus on sustainable and equitable development rather than perpetual expansion.**

        1. **Design:**
            - When designing for economic degrowth and decoupling, consider the following key principles**

        2. **Resource Efficiency:**
            - Optimize resource use to reduce waste and depletion.
            - Emphasize recycling and circular economy principles.

        3. **Localism:**
            - Encourage local production and consumption to reduce transportation-related environmental costs.
            - Support local businesses and communities.

        4. **Social Equity:**
            - Ensure that economic activities benefit society as a whole and promote social justice.
            - Address inequalities in access to resources and opportunities.

        5. **Quality of Life:**
            - Shift the focus from sheer economic growth to improving the overall well-being of individuals and communities.
            - Prioritize health, education, and leisure over excessive material consumption.

        6. **Innovation and Technology:**
            - Foster innovation that enhances sustainability and reduces environmental impact.
            - Embrace technologies that enable decoupling of economic growth from resource use.

        7. **Regulation and Policy:**
            - Implement and advocate for policies that incentivize sustainable practices.
            - Create regulations that discourage environmentally harmful activities.

        8. **Measuring Success:**
            - Redefine success metrics beyond GDP, considering well-being, environmental indicators, and social progress.
            - Develop alternative measures that reflect the goals of economic degrowth and decoupling.

        9. **Education and Awareness:**
            - Raise awareness about the principles and benefits of economic degrowth and decoupling.
            - Promote education on sustainable living and consumption patterns.

        10. **Collaboration:**
            - Foster collaboration between governments, businesses, and communities to implement and support sustainable practices.
            - Share knowledge and best practices globally.

        By keeping these principles in mind, designers can contribute to creating systems that align with the goals of economic degrowth and decoupling, promoting a more sustainable and equitable future.

        **Three key question suggested from Andres**

        1. **Suffiences**
            - To having an adequate amount of something, being self-sufficient or having enough resources.

        2. **Consumption** (efficient use of resources) & **Production** (generating enough resources)

        3. **FairyTale** from the Nation/ the Country/ the States

        **BUG**: How to solve the trash and either make it to a functional or aesthetic. To let the ==Pretty== & ==Ugly== to stay at a balance. </font>

        > It was nice to have the winter break spent in Jamaica. It helped me enlarge my perspective on seeing the world and rethink about the environment and waste. Several weak signals in Jamaica:

        **Waste Management Observations:**

        1. The understanding of waste/trash is different compared to the city:
            - For example, people in the city will throw the garbage into the trash can, and the trash company will help us deal with that waste. But people in Jamaica, who live in nature, will burn the trash/garbage. So, considering the pollution or health situation from burning plastic just right next to you while playing dominoes or swimming in the river.
            - Also, the age of the trash: People living in the city will throw away new plastic or trash immediately after they finish using it. But people I met in Jamaica will reuse the waste.
            - (Can we design a machine that can dissolve and break down the waste in the local neighborhood and print it as a new usable thing?)

        2. The ecosystem is amazing in Jamaica, its the gift from the sky, so when I saw a garbage mountain in the middle of amazing envirnoment, my heart start break down. 

        **Noise Pollution from Sound Systems:**

        2. A good point from Jamaican teenager Chris: The issue of sound pollution from sound systems."

            - _Impact on Community Well-being:_ The Jamaican teenager mention of sound systems and noise pollution highlights a potential environmental concern. Balancing the cultural significance of events with the well-being of local communities is crucial.

        **Lack of technological skills**

        - I couldn't help but notice the genuine curiosity people have about technology. It's amusing that whenever someone saw my phone, the first question was always, "Which iPhone is this?" Despite this interest, there's a twist – many locals face a challenge as they lack both knowledge and financial means to actively engage in societal activities.

        - It's interesting to witness the excitement people have for modern gadgets, especially iPhones. However, the reality is that not everyone can fully dive into technology due to limited resources and knowledge.

        - The mix of curiosity and limited access to information and financial resources creates a unique situation. There's interest, yet the pace of life seems laid-back, possibly because not everyone can fully participate in the digital world.

        - My experience in Jamaica raises questions about the connection between technology, knowledge, and socioeconomic factors. How can we bridge the gap and empower communities to be more actively involved in the digital age? Initiatives focusing on digital literacy or making technology more accessible could play a significant role in creating a more inclusive and engaged society.

    > This is a sensitive topic for my identity, but strangely, I am very interested in this subject. My bachelor's degree thesis utilized the iceberg theory from Freudian psychology, and I designed a speakeasy social club or dispensary in the Lower East Side of NYC. However, when I returned to New York after three years, after they legalized everything, everything had taken on a different flavor. I saw many dispensaries, and their lights were shining brighter than the lights on an operating table. Is this really a right or safe thing to do?
