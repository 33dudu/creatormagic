    !!! note ""

        ==Time Traveler== is a thought-provoking art installation that challenges traditional aesthetics and materiality. Crafted from discarded egg cartons sourced from the renowned Barcelona restaurant, Hanhan, this piece embodies the transformative power of art. Ingeniously fashioned into triangular modules by the artist, these overlooked cartons showcase the limitless possibilities of repurposing waste.

        As viewers engage with the sculpture, they are encouraged to contemplate the interplay between form and function, as well as broader themes of sustainability and human creativity. Through ”Time Traveler,“ we collectively reflect on the impact of our consumer culture on the environment and advocate for more responsible behavior.

        This inaugural piece marks the beginning of a larger artistic exploration, with plans to incorporate additional interactive elements and delve deeper into the concept of time. ”Time Traveler“ represents the enduring power of art to inspire reflection, foster dialogue, and catalyze change.

!!! example "COMMUNITY"
    Before the winter holiday, I collected TRA:moneybag:H
    from a restaurant named **HANHAN** in Barcelona. The owners are third-generation immigrants from China, and their signature dish is the Chinese pancake, which involves using a significant amount of eggs. Consequently, they produce a substantial number of egg plates. I requested the empty plates from them, and after several months of collecting, I ended up with a considerable amount of "TRA:moneybag:H "

!!! question "Chinese New Year2024"

    > Now, with the approaching Chinese New Year from February 9th to February 24th, coinciding with the Year of the Dragon, I intend to reciprocate to the HANHAN restaurant by presenting an art installation that symbolizes the Chinese New Year. This initiative marks my initial endeavor to transform the concept of "TRASH = The hidden gold." By creatively returning the collected trash in a more aesthetically and meaningfully designed way, this installation serves as both a gesture of appreciation and a test to gauge community reception. I'm intrigued to discover whether, through this artistic representation, the community still perceives these items as mere trash or if they find value in this transformed and meaningful expression.

        :question: What is ALTERNATIVE?
        
        - In design, the term **"alternative"** refers to unconventional or non-traditional approaches, solutions, or concepts that deviate from the mainstream or common practices. Designers often explore alternatives to push creative boundaries, solve problems in innovative ways, and challenge established norms. 


        :question: **Present continuities**

        - The current ways people deal with waste on Earth are divided between urban and natural environments. Let's focus on urban areas. Before the holiday, I asked for help from two Chinese restaurants to collect the wasted of the egg trays. These trays are considered garbage by the restaurant staff. After using the eggs, they discard the trays, creating a cycle of this material.

        :question: **Alternative Present**

        - Every time I visit these restaurants, due to my background, I notice many shortcomings in how they organize their space and tabletops. However, if we were to directly address this with them, they might opt to purchase new "trash containers." If possible, we could utilize the waste they collect and, through our design thinking, create items that are not only unique but also useful for them. This could be a solution.
