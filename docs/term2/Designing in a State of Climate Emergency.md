        My privilege is my Bi-polar mental healthy. It's turning my emotional struggles into a privilege for my art. Initially, I grappled with the challenges of unstable mental health, but delving into the worlds of art history and psychology changed my perspective.

        Studying these subjects allowed me to form a deep connection with myself. Rather than viewing my emotional challenges negatively, I embraced them as allies in my creative process. The profound feelings that once troubled me have now become the driving force behind my artistic expression.

        Through art, I've found a beautiful way to befriend myself. Every stroke on the canvas becomes a release, and the emotional richness infuses my work with authenticity. It's not just about stabilizing my mental well-being; it's about turning vulnerability into strength.

        This fusion of emotional exploration and artistic expression has become a privilege — a source of inspiration that allows me to create art that is not only visually striking but also deeply meaningful. In embracing the tumultuous waves of my emotions, I've discovered the power of turning personal challenges into a canvas of beauty and resilience.

        Film: Metropolis(1927)
        !!! abstract "ChatGPT"
            "Metropolis" is a German expressionist science-fiction film directed by Fritz Lang. It was released in 1927 and is considered one of the pioneering works of the science fiction genre in cinema. Here are some key points about the film:

            **Director:** Fritz Lang

            **Release Date:** January 10, 1927

            **Genre:** Science Fiction, Dystopian

            **Plot Summary:**
            "Metropolis" is set in a futuristic dystopian city divided into two classes: the wealthy elite who live in luxurious skyscrapers above ground, and the oppressed working class who toil in harsh conditions below ground. The city is governed by Joh Fredersen, who oversees the construction of a massive skyscraper called the "New Tower of Babel." The protagonist, Freder, is the son of Joh Fredersen. When he discovers the plight of the workers, he becomes determined to bridge the gap between the classes.

            The film explores themes of class struggle, industrialization, and the consequences of unchecked technological progress. It also features a humanoid robot called Maria, created by the inventor Rotwang, who becomes a central figure in the narrative.

            **Influence and Legacy:**
            "Metropolis" is celebrated for its groundbreaking special effects, innovative set design, and iconic imagery. The film's visual style, characterized by elaborate and monumental sets, has left a lasting impact on the science fiction genre and cinema as a whole.

            Despite its initial critical and commercial challenges, "Metropolis" has since gained recognition as a classic and influential film. Various restored versions have been released over the years, and it continues to be studied and appreciated for its cinematic achievements and its thematic exploration of societal issues.

            The film's influence can be seen in later science fiction works, including Ridley Scott's "Blade Runner" and many other dystopian films that explore the consequences of a divided society. "Metropolis" remains a significant part of film history, showcasing the artistic and storytelling possibilities of the medium.
