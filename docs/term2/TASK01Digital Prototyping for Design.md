        > The first time I played around with biomaterial was during the IAAC Poblenou Open Night. The component I chose needed to be inside water to achieve its shape, which was super interesting to me since I personally love water and the ocean. After obtaining the materials, I braided a bracelet as a small test, which turned out very nice. I imagine that if I use this type of material to create a tropical tank sea grass, it will be very stunning.
