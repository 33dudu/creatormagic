        1. **A complex world**

            - Everything happens so much

            > Things are more complex and interconnected and also we perceive them differently, we are differently attuned, because of technology.
            ---Loyisa Heinrich

            - Climate: the fundamental chanllege

            > Everything that anyone is doing anywhere in the world will be harder because of climate change. So......
        
        2. **A divided world**

            - Generation gaps

        3. **The AI boom**

            - "A 10-year wormhole into the future"

            > AI was a 10 year wormhole into the future. 10 years of progress is a lot in one go! So we're in this capability overhang; a lot is now possible, but it takes time to imagine and diges. 
            - Matt Webb, Acts Not Facts

            - Automation, data, and "super systems"

            >[Azeem Azhar, Exponential View](https://hbr.org/2019/04/podcast-exponential-view):point_left:

            - The path to ubiquity

            > There are people on Discords that are building better models than Open AI is, right? -Brain Whiteman


        4. **New interactions**

            - Fuzziness, fluidity and friends

            > I do think there's something about the switch from numerical binary Nick Foster

            - Smart homes, connected devices, and multimodal interaction

            > Modality is changing. The modality of how we access content is changing.- Renuka Gupta, BBCs

            - Extended reality and spatial computing

            > You can imagine the sales pitch: we see a mountain. We see a lake. Then the voiceover goes "the real world is great, but lets ..."Spencer Marsden, BBC

        5. **The case for hope**

            > Hope just means another world might be possible, not promise, not guaranteed. Hope calls for action; action is impossible without hope. - Rebecca Solnit, Hope in the Dark
