        !!! note "Emotion Detection"
            1. **Vision Based Techniques:**
                - Speech Recognition
                - Facial Recognition
                - Gait Recognition (how we walk)
                - Gaze Recognition (how we look)

            2. **Physiological data signal analysis:**
                - EEG (Electroenceohalogram): measures electrical activity in the brain
                - ECG (Electrocardiogram): records the electrical signals in the heart
                - EMG (Electromygram): muscle movement control
                - GSR (Galvanic Skin Response): electrical changes in the skin caused by sweat gland activity
                - RSP (Respiration ):measuring the physical change of the thoracic expansion with a rubber band around the chest or belly

        !!! note "Emotion Detection & Machine Learning"
            :question: What a Machine Learning System is and needs:

            0. Data sets

            1. Algorithms (Neural nets, Markov Chains, etc...)

            2. Models (trained)
