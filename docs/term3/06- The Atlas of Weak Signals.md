            > I'd like to start with the background graphic of this card. The background depicts the tuned mass damper sphere within Taipei 101. It's a crucial technology that helps balance the building's height and mitigate the impact of wind forces, especially in tall structures. The creation of this card coincided with Taiwan experiencing a 7.3 magnitude earthquake, prompting me to contemplate further. Through this natural disaster, we delve deeper into considering the balance between the realities and virtual realities of today's society. While an earthquake may be merely a fantasy in the virtual world, it's an inevitable disaster in reality. Therefore, this card aims to awaken people's climate consciousness and spark reflection on the balance between humanity and technology.

            > In the era of WEB 3.0 & 4.0, maintaining a balance between humanity and technology is paramount. Some argue that machine rights should not surpass those of humans. For example, in the real world, people may feel lost without technology, and time serves as a prime illustration. Only through technology, such as electronic screens, do people become aware of the existence of time, which might simply be a series of numbers. Therefore, we need to recognize that while technology brings convenience, we also need to strike a balance between humanity and technology to avoid losing touch with the real world."
