        > "It was a great opportunity to have the Micro Challenge III combined with the Pure Gold workshop. The Pure Gold workshop is a four-day full-day immersive experience. By using trash to rethink and redesign it for upcycling, we aimed to achieve the goal of top-down, bottom-up sustainability. During the four days of the workshop, I learned a lot. I questioned myself: **what makes a good designer?** **Am I creating a new art installation or am I simply producing more trash?** As the workshop concluded, I left with a renewed perspective on design and a commitment to continue exploring innovative ways to repurpose materials and create meaningful, sustainable art. Additionally, through interactive art, I solidified my goal of incorporating technology and intelligence to bring the **tra$h to life**."

        !!! warning "For future"
            > During the presentation, I received many useful feedback. One particularly interesting comment was about the appeal of the sounds produced by the [33]. These sounds, generated by the servo motor, were well-received, especially when combined with the egg carton facade, which provided effective acoustic insulation to prevent them from becoming annoying. Another point raised was the desire for enhanced interactivity, particularly in relation to the opening and closing movements of the trash, symbolizing the breathing process, and the interaction of light with these movements. The future goal is to create a more immersive experience, making the coral's breathing feel more authentic and lifelike.

        !!! bug ""
            "This project combines a PIR motion sensor, an LED strip, and a continuous rotation servo motor controlled by an ESP32 microcontroller. The PIR sensor detects motion, triggering the LED strip to illuminate in yellow when motion is detected and purple when there is no motion. Simultaneously, the servo motor controls the movement of a 'tra$h coral', symbolizing the rebirth of discarded items. The servo motor opens and closes the 'trash flower' in response to motion, creating an interactive and visually captivating experience. This project aims to showcase the potential of repurposing and cherishing discarded materials, turning them to alive."
