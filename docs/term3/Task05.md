        !!! abstract "Reflection" 
            > I really like these two software [Max] and [Zipsim]. They are easy to understand, especially since my background has nothing to do with coding. This visual type of coding is easy for me to understand and play around with. Especially with [Zipsim], which offers several choices of sensors. By testing and playing around, I have gained a clear understanding of what each type of sensor does. Overall, these software have been incredibly helpful in expanding my knowledge and skills in this area.
