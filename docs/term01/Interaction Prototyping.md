        ## What is Llum?

        Llum (Catalan for "light") is a major annual light festival held in Barcelona, Spain. The festival transforms the Poblenou neighborhood into a creative canvas where artists, designers, and architects present innovative light installations. It usually takes place in February and is part of the broader Santa EulÃ lia Festival, one of Barcelona's major winter celebrations.

        At the beginning of the seminar, we divided into four groups. In our group, we had Atakan, Dounia, Nathan, Nyan, and me. Our concept is to bring dreams back to reality. Welcome to DREAM WORLD (MÃ“N DELS SOMNIS), an immersive labyrinth of surreal dreamscapes.

        Walls of tapestries surround the site, creating loose, wandering pathways that guide you to gathering centers. The images projected onto the sheets are familiar yet odd â€“ warm and inviting, yet uncomfortable and strange, with a liminal feel. Shapes and forms found in the site and the natural elements of Barcelona are also projected, but they appear twisted and surreal, heightening the sense of a distorted dream reality.

        As you progress through the site, and as more people enter, the scenes and sounds around you become increasingly bizarre and unsettling. This progression reflects the growing blur between reality and the digital world. As more of our social connections occur online, will we eventually struggle to distinguish between what is real and what is digital?

        ## Although our concept was not selected, this does not mean we failed. The four groupsâ€™ concepts were evaluated, and the best one was chosen. The decision was made for everyone to support the winning group and help bring their project to life. I chose to join the Supercomputer group to assist with the image style and visuals, contributing to the development and realization of their project.
