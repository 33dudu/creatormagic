    ## What is Llum?

    Llum (Catalan for "light") is a major annual light festival held in Barcelona, Spain. The festival transforms the Poblenou neighborhood into a creative canvas where artists, designers, and architects present innovative light installations. It usually takes place in February and is part of the broader Santa Eul√†lia Festival, one of Barcelona's major winter celebrations.
