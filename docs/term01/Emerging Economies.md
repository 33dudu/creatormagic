        Key Focus: Resource efficiency, waste reduction, and sustainable value cycles.

        ## 2. Distributed Economies and Massive Collaboration
    
        Definition: A decentralized economic system where production, resources, and decision-making are spread across localized units, enhanced by large-scale collaboration across sectors, communities, and technologies.

        Key Focus: Local empowerment, collective innovation, and networked collaboration for economic resilience.

!!! example "Reflection"
    Below is the class exercise we did for each class. It consists of a few questions to answer for each economic model. Besides that, I really enjoyed this long seminar. Each week, we had a different expert introduce us to a new economic model. This helped me a lot with my thesis project by encouraging me to rethink or broaden my perspective.
