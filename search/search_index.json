The sculpture is made with WASTES.  I was questioning myself /HOW TO TREAT WASTES ARTISTICALLY?/ `10/28/2023` I started ask myself two questions   /Which bio materials are the most commonly wasted at my home?/  /Which organic food materials are the most commonly wasted at my home?/ The answers are /Makeup remover towel &amp; Toilet paper roll/ /Coffee powder &amp; Egg shell/   Then I  tested the  materials during the weekend to see if the new material can be hard enough to make a sculpture? There are two ways to dry my material which is  / No.1 by using heavy things to press it and put it in indoor space for two days./ / No.2 by using Mediterranean sunshine and wind(outdoor) for two days./ 10/31/2023 After testing the new material there is a little bag of leftovers. During class time I found a WASTED HARD DISK DRIVE in IAAC room 301. I used the wasted hard disk drive as a MOLDER.  Then I start put the leftover material into the hard disk I used No.2 (sunshine &amp; wind) method to dry the sculpture. Use myself as an instrument, the most important is the way to see the world; the perspective; the vision. For the next step I would like to make a second version of the waste materials. By adding one more step: use the mortar to smash the egg shell. Also, made two colors, by adding the coffee powder and without coffee powder.
