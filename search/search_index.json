Using a computer-aided design (CAD) model as a blueprint, the printer adds material layer by layer, whether it\u2019s thermoplastic, resin, or metal, to form a solid object. Different printing technologies, such as Fused Deposition Modeling (FDM), Stereolithography (SLA), or Selective Laser Sintering (SLS), dictate the type of material and the layering process, resulting in a tangible product that mirrors the digital design.</p> <p>How does it work? </p> <p>The 3D printer works by interpreting a digital 3D model, slicing it into thin horizontal layers using specialized software, and then building the object layer by layer through additive manufacturing. Depending on the technology used, the printer deposits material, such as thermoplastic filament, liquid resin, or metal powder, layer by layer, with each layer fusing to the one below. The material is solidified using various methods like heating, UV curing, or laser sintering, resulting in a three-dimensional object that matches the digital design.</p> <p>How it\u2019s built? </p> <p>The 3D printer is constructed using a combination of mechanical, electronic, and software components. Mechanically, it features a frame that houses the moving parts, including the print head or extruder, and a build platform. These components are driven by motors, guided by linear rails or rods, ensuring precise movements on the X, Y, and Z axes. Electronically, a main control board processes digital instructions from the slicing software, directing the motors and regulating the temperature of the print head or curing source. Additionally, various sensors monitor conditions like temperature and filament presence, while the software interface allows users to configure settings, load models, and initiate the printing process.</p> <p>Why it failed, or it wasn\u2019t used anymore?</p> <p>The 3D printer still functions, but it\u2019s an older, unstable model with low accuracy and print quality.</p> <p>Steps taken:</p> <ol> <li> <p>Cleaned the dust off the printer and brought it to the MDEF room</p> </li> <li> <p>Disassembled using our toolbox</p> </li> <li> <p>Separated into three main parts as follows:</p> <ul> <li> <p>The plate - Horizontal surface that also gets heated and can be moved in all directions and where the plastic is printed on;</p> </li> <li> <p>The structural part - The part that supports the entire printing machine;</p> </li> <li> <p>The extruder - Contains the motors to print 3D filament;</p> </li> </ul> </li> <li> <p>Laid out all parts individually and documented.</p> </li> </ol> <p>Results</p> <p>How many motors did we find inside?</p> <p>Five motors - they are used to move the extruder in the three axis to permit drawing in 3D space.</p> <p>Does it contain a computer or microcontroller?</p> <p>Yes, an Arduino board and a RAMPS.</p> <p>Did you found any sensors?</p> <p>Yes, temperature sensors.</p> <p>Conclusions</p> <p>What did you learn?</p> <ul> <li> <p>How a 3D printer is assembled</p> </li> <li> <p>How a 3D printer works</p> </li> <li> <p>How to power up each component individually</p> </li> <li> <p>Fundamental electronics</p> </li> <li> <p>How a step motor works</p> </li> </ul> <p>What surprised you?</p> <ul> <li> <p>The number of components, screws and pieces the printer had</p> </li> <li> <p>The fact that we can make the extruder work with just 3 components</p> </li> <li> <p>How easy and repareable it is</p> </li> <li> <p>How much the 3D technology has improved since 2015</p> </li> </ul> <p>References</p> <ul> <li>https://www.bcn3d.com/ca/arxius-open-source/</li> <li>https://reprapbcn.wordpress.com/tag/3dprinter/</li> <li>https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MJ61LIdlyww</li> </ul> <p>LifeX</p> <p>At its core, LifeX uses the X-axis motor and belt system.

Interest During my undergraduate studies, I pursued a double major in Interior Architecture and Art History. However, my particular passion lies in Art History. I am intrigued by the origins of each art movement, the underlying logic and philosophical aspects, and the reasons leading to their eventual manifestations. Throughout my exploration of Art History, I actively traced the roots of each art movement, delving deep into their ideologies and philosophical foundations. I gained a profound understanding of how societal, cultural, and historical factors influence art movements. I sought to comprehend the origins and development of these movements from an artistic perspective, considering the unique environments and social contexts of each period. Each art movement is like a canvas saturated with the thoughts and reflections of artists of that time. I am excited by the unique creativity and ideas that emerge within these movements. Through artworks spanning different eras, I aim to understand how artists serve as cultural commentators of their times by expressing their viewpoints and emotions. While pursuing a profound understanding of art movements, my interest extends to the evolution of their ultimate forms. I believe that interpreting artworks from logical and philosophical perspectives not only aids in appreciating their aesthetics but also reveals deeper layers of thoughts and emotions embedded in these creations. In summary, my academic background fuels my deep curiosity about the origins and development of art movements. I look forward to further exploring and understanding the cultural and philosophical implications of different art movements and how they have influenced the evolution and presentation of art. <p> </p> <p>Quote</p> <p>For further FUTURE</p> <ol> <li> <p>Social and Historical Background:</p> <p>Examine the societal, political, and cultural environment of specific periods, understanding the social upheavals and intellectual trends that often influence the development of art.</p> </li> <li> <p>Artists and Thinkers:</p> <p>Study the major artists and thinkers within specific art movements, gaining insights into their perspectives, ideologies, creative motivations, and how they propelled the movement forward.</p> </li> <li> <p>Technological and Innovative Aspects:</p> <p>Investigate the technologies and innovations associated with art movements, including painting techniques, sculptural methods, photographic advancements, etc. Technological changes often play a significant role in the evolution of artistic forms.</p> </li> <li> <p>Artistic Theory:</p> <p>Understand the theoretical foundations of particular art movements, including considerations of artistic viewpoints, aesthetic concepts, and the philosophical reflections on artistic goals.</p> </li> <li> <p>Social Impact:</p> <p>Examine the societal impact of specific art movements, encompassing their influence on the public, critics, and other artists.
