Using a computer-aided design (CAD) model as a blueprint, the printer adds material layer by layer, whether it\u2019s thermoplastic, resin, or metal, to form a solid object. Different printing technologies, such as Fused Deposition Modeling (FDM), Stereolithography (SLA), or Selective Laser Sintering (SLS), dictate the type of material and the layering process, resulting in a tangible product that mirrors the digital design.</p> <p>How does it work? </p> <p>The 3D printer works by interpreting a digital 3D model, slicing it into thin horizontal layers using specialized software, and then building the object layer by layer through additive manufacturing. Depending on the technology used, the printer deposits material, such as thermoplastic filament, liquid resin, or metal powder, layer by layer, with each layer fusing to the one below. The material is solidified using various methods like heating, UV curing, or laser sintering, resulting in a three-dimensional object that matches the digital design.</p> <p>How it\u2019s built? </p> <p>The 3D printer is constructed using a combination of mechanical, electronic, and software components. Mechanically, it features a frame that houses the moving parts, including the print head or extruder, and a build platform. These components are driven by motors, guided by linear rails or rods, ensuring precise movements on the X, Y, and Z axes. Electronically, a main control board processes digital instructions from the slicing software, directing the motors and regulating the temperature of the print head or curing source. Additionally, various sensors monitor conditions like temperature and filament presence, while the software interface allows users to configure settings, load models, and initiate the printing process.</p> <p>Why it failed, or it wasn\u2019t used anymore?</p> <p>The 3D printer still functions, but it\u2019s an older, unstable model with low accuracy and print quality.</p> <p>Steps taken:</p> <ol> <li> <p>Cleaned the dust off the printer and brought it to the MDEF room</p> </li> <li> <p>Disassembled using our toolbox</p> </li> <li> <p>Separated into three main parts as follows:</p> <ul> <li> <p>The plate - Horizontal surface that also gets heated and can be moved in all directions and where the plastic is printed on;</p> </li> <li> <p>The structural part - The part that supports the entire printing machine;</p> </li> <li> <p>The extruder - Contains the motors to print 3D filament;</p> </li> </ul> </li> <li> <p>Laid out all parts individually and documented.</p> </li> </ol> <p>Results</p> <p>How many motors did we find inside?</p> <p>Five motors - they are used to move the extruder in the three axis to permit drawing in 3D space.</p> <p>Does it contain a computer or microcontroller?</p> <p>Yes, an Arduino board and a RAMPS.</p> <p>Did you found any sensors?</p> <p>Yes, temperature sensors.</p> <p>Conclusions</p> <p>What did you learn?</p> <ul> <li> <p>How a 3D printer is assembled</p> </li> <li> <p>How a 3D printer works</p> </li> <li> <p>How to power up each component individually</p> </li> <li> <p>Fundamental electronics</p> </li> <li> <p>How a step motor works</p> </li> </ul> <p>What surprised you?</p> <ul> <li> <p>The number of components, screws and pieces the printer had</p> </li> <li> <p>The fact that we can make the extruder work with just 3 components</p> </li> <li> <p>How easy and repareable it is</p> </li> <li> <p>How much the 3D technology has improved since 2015</p> </li> </ul> <p>References</p> <ul> <li>https://www.bcn3d.com/ca/arxius-open-source/</li> <li>https://reprapbcn.wordpress.com/tag/3dprinter/</li> <li>https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MJ61LIdlyww</li> </ul> <p>LifeX</p> <p>Machine Outlook</p> <p> </p> <p>Bookmark Outlook</p> <p> </p> <p>At its core, LifeX uses the X-axis motor and belt system.

The palette expands, introducing two colors: 1. with the richness of coffee powder. 2. in its pure, unadorned form.</p> <p>As the project unfolds, it becomes more than just a sculpture; it transforms into a narrative of renewal, where discarded materials find beauty, purpose, and a second chance.

Interest During my undergraduate studies, I pursued a double major in Interior Architecture and Art History. However, my particular passion lies in Art History. I am intrigued by the origins of each art movement, the underlying logic and philosophical aspects, and the reasons leading to their eventual manifestations. Throughout my exploration of Art History, I actively traced the roots of each art movement, delving deep into their ideologies and philosophical foundations. I gained a profound understanding of how societal, cultural, and historical factors influence art movements. I sought to comprehend the origins and development of these movements from an artistic perspective, considering the unique environments and social contexts of each period. Each art movement is like a canvas saturated with the thoughts and reflections of artists of that time. I am excited by the unique creativity and ideas that emerge within these movements. Through artworks spanning different eras, I aim to understand how artists serve as cultural commentators of their times by expressing their viewpoints and emotions. While pursuing a profound understanding of art movements, my interest extends to the evolution of their ultimate forms. I believe that interpreting artworks from logical and philosophical perspectives not only aids in appreciating their aesthetics but also reveals deeper layers of thoughts and emotions embedded in these creations. In summary, my academic background fuels my deep curiosity about the origins and development of art movements.

On this trip to Barcelona, I bought my magic book at a local store called Papirvm. The store is elegant and ancient. The outer layer of this magic book is brown leather , and inside is blank white paper. The entire magic book smells like an old library, which is my favorite scent because when I was young, I used to hide in the school library warehouse and read Shakespeare\u2019s comic books (by the way, when I was young, I thought Shakespeare was a woman until I went to Shakespeare\u2019s home in England at the age of eleven and found out that he was actually a man. It\u2019s really interesting to think about this - as an Asian, I had biases about European people\u2019s hair:)). The one who sold me this notebook was an old lady, and all the notebooks in the store were handmade by them, from paper making to sewing into a book. It feels like a connection to a kind of energy, a connection to the spirit of craftsmanship. However, I don\u2019t record everything in this magic book, only specific interesting things are recorded in it. I cherish this magic book very much, and I carefully storage it into a packaging bag like a takeout bag.Each page within holds not just words but a magic; a magic connect between past, present and future.  <p>Group Narrative</p> <p>Time Lapse took by Carmen  : </p> <p> </p> <p>Handnotes took by Vania  : </p> <p></p> <p>Possible structure terms: </p> -One day\u2026 -Until\u2026 -Then\u2026 -The end\u2026 <p>Important notes:</p> you cannot use I or We. Neither me, mine, our, ourselves. Myself. So find a way to do it.  Yeah. But you need to be aware about the meaning. So, in terms of if you want to say situated glossary The meaning that you are using or creating for the journal. So it\u2019s also about speculating, such as for example with this magic machine, also the paradox. So you can use fiction as a tool to write your collective storytelling about these material experiences during these weeks. Or these material entanglements happening during weeks. Sorry, that was not the best figure. <p>Idea: </p> Everyone writes X sentences, then the next person goes and continues the collective story.  <p>The story:</p> It is funny how an accumilation of choices can lead a group of people to come together. People who a little more then a month ago were strangers have become a community working to create a better future. Little did they know that the present was gonna be the craziest challenge they ever faced.The members of the group come from diverse nationalities and ethnic backgrounds, yet collectively, they share a common experience of navigating through the intricate processes of attaining city citizenship and utilizing it to acquire a commute card amidst the challenges of bureaucratic procedures. From this primordial soup of individuals and cultures, however, some questions arise: what is really the difference between their personal and professional identities? Are they only here to work together? It seems more like these players are trying to transform their personal ideals into concrete action. The correct answer to the question doesn\u2019t exist. It\u2019s up to the group to embark on this new adventure and ask even more questions. Whether it\u2019s by engaging the newfound tools of the world to act on simple interactions, by analysing the enviroment lived to learn learn and learn or to by simply living in community and add up a new experience of co-living with different cultures, languages, materials, technologies, spaces, species\u2026 The journey of this eclectic assembly it\u2019s a profound exploration of self within the tapestry of a new society. As they juggle the demands of their individual lives with the collective needs, each member is crafting a unique narrative, shaped by shared struggles and triumphs. This experience may test their limits, but it also offers an opportunity to redefine their understanding of community and identity in an ever-evolving world. The shared adventure forms a community that celebrates milestones, cares for one another, and evolves into a unique system of mutual learning and support. Deep conversations about the future, technology, and all of the possibilities that lie ahead are happening everyday, and it\u2019s up to the group to use them to shape the next part of the story.It can be easy to forget, amidst the noise and haste of constant learning and unlearning, of different ways of doing, that having fun is the key. Engaging in ways of exploration and conversation that spark joy and curiosity, lies the groups hidden path to exploring the unfamiliar.This seemingly infinite and endless network, forking and merging, could, through the constant drive to challenge and prove assumptions, gather inspiring experiences for individuals who want to put themselves in this perspective of reality. This means also realizing failure during the process, an indispensable facet of the human experience.Acknowledging failure not as a dead-end but as a portal to enlightenment, one discovers the essence of resilience and adaptability, not only in learning from personal blunders but also in gleaning wisdom from the experiences of others. Failure constitutes an integral facet of the evolutionary journey. Embracing risk is essential for community advancement, and failure is an inherent component of such risks. Within the realm of uncertainty, novel discoveries await, even if accompanied by potential fear and exposure. Valuable lessons emerge from failure, offering a pathway to address topics often neglected or considered taboo. Risk-taking presents opportunities for the existence of these transformative moments shared together. In addition to learning to value failure, this group learned the power of the collective. Learning with each other means learning from one another. Individual design spaces were deeply enriched and expanded by sharing thoughts and ideas with classmates, and many assigments would have never been achieved without collaboration. If in the future one could observe the life paths followed by each of these people from this moment on. And, at the same time one could overlap the paths they would have followed if they had never met in space time.  Maybe, just maybe we would understand a little bit how this experience has shaped their lives. Between the sunrise and the sunset millions questions will shows up to the brain. by answering those question gente used the vision to noticed the informations and solutions. Vision is different in every gente. Nowdays, gente lived with technology. Also, millions creations borned. The new borned babies involved into Gente-Tech Art movement; where the dream starts to come true. Yet, in the midst of continual learning and unlearning, amidst the various approaches, it\u2019s easy to overlook that fun is essential. Participating in exploratory conversations that spark joy and curiosity unveils the group\u2019s secret journey to explore the unknown. This seemingly boundless and ever-shifting network of connections, with its twists and turns, might, by consistently challenging assumptions, accumulate enriching experiences for those who want to embrace this outlook on reality. Moreover, these diverse experiences and shared challenges of the group risk fading into memory. Documentation,is the useful source to capture the essence of their journey, preserving wisdom from failures and collective learning. It serves as a tangible record, enabling reflection, celebration of milestones, and informed shaping of the group\u2019s future. Time will tell how these group of students are going to be changed as professionals and as individual people.But always are going to have the documentation and the learning of the MDEF year This could be an opportunity to explore what it really means to have every opportunity lie ahead. To understand what it means to be one with everything and nothing in the body of a creator. To realise that every miracle once attributed to a god could also be in a group of 22 (sweetie pie) students who all crossed into one reality by making the same decision to be here.  <p>Link to the original writing board: </p> <p>Classnotes</p> <p> <p>Personal Narratives</p> <p><pre><code>    graph LR\n    A[Personal] --&gt; B[Private/self];</code></pre> <pre><code>    graph LR\n    A[Narrative] --&gt; B[Tell/relate];</code></pre> <pre><code>    graph LR\n    A[Narration] --&gt; B[Action/telling a story];</code></pre></p> <p>Story Telling</p> <p>Act or art of relating stories</p> <p>Positive Power</p> <p>Positive/ Affirmative/Empowering = Potencia (the political) Critique as creativity</p> <p>Negative Power</p> <p>Negative/ Restrictive/ Oppressive = Potestas (the political) Politics as usual </p> <p>Planetary Scale</p> <p>Personal vs. Collective</p> <pre><code>    graph LR\n    A[Personal] --&gt; B{Copy};\n    B --&gt;|Plus/+/| C{Paste};\n    C --&gt;|Plus/+/| D{Cut};</code></pre> <pre><code>    graph LR\n    A[Collective] --&gt; B{Copy};\n    B --&gt;|Plus/+/| C{Paste};</code></pre> <p>Narrative vs. Storytelling</p> <pre><code>    graph LR\n    A[Narrative] \n    A --&gt;|Minus/-/| B{adj.};</code></pre> <pre><code>    graph LR\n    A[Storytelling]\n    A --&gt;|Plus/+/| B{adj.};</code></pre> <p>Problem Solver</p> <p></p>"},{"location":"term1/Collective%20Stories/#we-are-in-this-together-but-we-are-not-one-and-the-same","title":"We-are-in-this-together-but-we-are-not-one-and-the-same","text":""},{"location":"term1/Collective%20Stories/#to-become-in-and-within-the-world","title":"To-become-in-and-with(in)-the-world","text":""},{"location":"term1/Collective%20Stories/#designer","title":"=Designer","text":""},{"location":"term1/Collective%20Stories/#artist","title":"=Artist","text":"<p>Recieving information {5 senses}</p>"},{"location":"term1/Design%20Dialogues/","title":"DESIGN DIALOGUES","text":"<p>PAST, PRESENT, FUTURE</p> <p>FACULTY: Guillem Camprodon/ Tomas Diez/ Laura Benitez/Jana Tothill Calvo/ Roger Guilemany/ Santiago Fuentemilla Garriga/ Josep Marti Elias/ Petra Garajov\u00e1/ Adai Surinach</p> <p>CALENDAR: 11/12/2023 - 19/12/2023</p> <p>TRACK: \u201c\u201dSHOWTIME\u201d\u201c</p> <p>KEYWORD: \u201c7 SINS/ ART THERAPY/ WASTES/ EDUCATION\u201d</p> <p>Quote</p> <p>"},{"location":"term1/Design%20Dialogues/#now-its-our-time-to-shine","title":"NOW, it\u2019s our-time to SHINE","text":"<p>Poster</p> <p>"},{"location":"term1/Design%20Dialogues/#comments-box-for-pastpresentfuture","title":"Comments box for  Past/Present/Future","text":"<p> <p></p> <p></p> <ul> <li> <p>The comments paper was a side waste collected from a print shop ( IMPRESI\u00d3N, DISE\u00d1O Y COLOR,  Carrer de Fluvi\u00e0, 217, BAJOS, Sant Mart\u00ed, 08020 Barcelona )</p> </li> <li> <p>The comment container was a waste water bottle.</p> <p>I got a lots of comments/feedback/debates: From MANY AMAZING PEOPLE BIG LOVE BIG THANKS  </p> </li> </ul> <p>GOAL</p> <p>Dialogue is a written or spoken conversational exchange between two or more people.

However, during my conversation with Tomas, he pointed out a crucial issue. Subsequently, I introspected and identified my weak point, which turned out to be technology.</p> <p>In an effort to address this, I explored the MDEF classroom and sought out abandoned machines that resonated with me. Ultimately, I settled on an old 80s TV. My goal was to connect it to my iPhone 14 Plus. After several attempts and searches, I succeeded.

Let me give a try to solve this bug.  <p>BUG: How to solve the trash and either make it to a functional or aesthetic. To let the Pretty &amp; Ugly to stay at a balance. </p> <p>It was nice to have the winter break spent in Jamaica. It helped me enlarge my perspective on seeing the world and rethink about the environment and waste. Several weak signals in Jamaica:</p> <p>Waste Management Observations:</p> <ol> <li> <p>The understanding of waste/trash is different compared to the city:</p> <ul> <li>For example, people in the city will throw the garbage into the trash can, and the trash company will help us deal with that waste. But people in Jamaica, who live in nature, will burn the trash/garbage. So, considering the pollution or health situation from burning plastic just right next to you while playing dominoes or swimming in the river.</li> <li>Also, the age of the trash: People living in the city will throw away new plastic or trash immediately after they finish using it. But people I met in Jamaica will reuse the waste.</li> <li>(Can we design a machine that can dissolve and break down the waste in the local neighborhood and print it as a new usable thing?)</li> </ul> </li> <li> <p>The ecosystem is amazing in Jamaica, its the gift from the sky, so when I saw a garbage mountain in the middle of amazing envirnoment, my heart start break down. </p> </li> </ol> <p>Noise Pollution from Sound Systems:</p> <ol> <li> <p>A good point from Jamaican teenager Chris: The issue of sound pollution from sound systems.\u201d</p> <ul> <li>Impact on Community Well-being: The Jamaican teenager mention of sound systems and noise pollution highlights a potential environmental concern. Balancing the cultural significance of events with the well-being of local communities is crucial.</li> </ul> </li> </ol> <p>Lack of technological skills</p> <ul> <li> <p>I couldn\u2019t help but notice the genuine curiosity people have about technology. It\u2019s amusing that whenever someone saw my phone, the first question was always, \u201cWhich iPhone is this?\u201d Despite this interest, there\u2019s a twist \u2013 many locals face a challenge as they lack both knowledge and financial means to actively engage in societal activities.</p> </li> <li> <p>It\u2019s interesting to witness the excitement people have for modern gadgets, especially iPhones. However, the reality is that not everyone can fully dive into technology due to limited resources and knowledge.</p> </li> <li> <p>The mix of curiosity and limited access to information and financial resources creates a unique situation. There\u2019s interest, yet the pace of life seems laid-back, possibly because not everyone can fully participate in the digital world.</p> </li> <li> <p>My experience in Jamaica raises questions about the connection between technology, knowledge, and socioeconomic factors. How can we bridge the gap and empower communities to be more actively involved in the digital age? Initiatives focusing on digital literacy or making technology more accessible could play a significant role in creating a more inclusive and engaged society.</p> </li> </ul> <ul> <li>Bali</li> </ul> <p>2.

It helped me enlarge my perspective on seeing the world and rethink about the environment and waste. Several weak signals in Jamaica:</p> <p>Waste Management Observations:</p> <ol> <li> <p>The understanding of waste/trash is different compared to the city:</p> <ul> <li>For example, people in the city will throw the garbage into the trash can, and the trash company will help us deal with that waste. But people in Jamaica, who live in nature, will burn the trash/garbage. So, considering the pollution or health situation from burning plastic just right next to you while playing dominoes or swimming in the river.</li> <li>Also, the age of the trash: People living in the city will throw away new plastic or trash immediately after they finish using it.

It\u2019s amusing that whenever someone saw my phone, the first question was always, \u201cWhich iPhone is this?\u201d Despite this interest, there\u2019s a twist \u2013 many locals face a challenge as they lack both knowledge and financial means to actively engage in societal activities.</p> </li> <li> <p>It\u2019s interesting to witness the excitement people have for modern gadgets, especially iPhones. However, the reality is that not everyone can fully dive into technology due to limited resources and knowledge.</p> </li> <li> <p>The mix of curiosity and limited access to information and financial resources creates a unique situation. There\u2019s interest, yet the pace of life seems laid-back, possibly because not everyone can fully participate in the digital world.</p> </li> <li> <p>My experience in Jamaica raises questions about the connection between technology, knowledge, and socioeconomic factors. How can we bridge the gap and empower communities to be more actively involved in the digital age? Initiatives focusing on digital literacy or making technology more accessible could play a significant role in creating a more inclusive and engaged society.</p> </li> </ul> <p>"},{"location":"term2/Designing%20in%20a%20State%20of%20Climate%20Emergency/#climate-emergency-in-new-york-usa","title":"Climate Emergency in New York, USA","text":"<p> Coming soon</p> <p></p>"}]}
